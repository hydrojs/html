# hydro-html

  A [hydro](//github.com/hydrojs/hydro) formatter which renders to the DOM

## WIP

Work in progress. Please do not use yet.

## Installation

With your favourite package manager:

- [packin](//github.com/jkroso/packin): `packin add hydro-html`
- [component](//github.com/component/component#installing-packages): `component install hydrojs/hydro-html`
- [npm](//npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-install.html): `npm install hydro-html`

Then set it as your formatter:

```js
hydro.set('formatter', require('hydro-html'))
```

## Thanks
